# Unlensed-Type-Ia-rate

SFR.py is for Star Formation Rate\
SNRL.py is for SNe Ia rate (z<=4) & Luminosity function calculation\
SNR.py is for SNe Ia rate (z<=1.5) & SNe Ia number calculation\
SNlcl.py is a Monte Carlo method to detemine the number of Type Ia observations by LSST in a year as a function of redshift. There are certain simplifications and assumptions, which can be modified easily as the code is flexible. The redshift step used is 0.01
